Especially, an awesome hairstyle with thick, long, and shiny locks add the magnetic touch. Healthy hair denotes a healthy person and is an important denominator of sexual selection. You are lucky if your hair is normal and there is no thinning. However many will argue that a bald person gives a masculine image. This point is debatable.</p>

		<br> SCut out a strip of skin from your donor region (mostly from your head itself) which is abundant in hair growth. We will then graft this strip on to the targeted bald area. (This procedure has been abandoned today by most clinics including ours) 
		<br><span class="headingstrip">FUE Hair grafting:</span><br> We can transplant individual hair grafts, which limits the concern of visible scarring.

			 A significant number of women suffer from hair loss at some point of their lives. In the case of postmenopausal women, hair thinning or bald spots are common problems. Female pattern baldness or androgenetic alopecia is the major type of hair loss in women and can severely affect their quality of life and emotional well-being. In this condition, one can notice gradual thinning at the parting line followed by an increasing amount of hair loss from the top of the head. As opposed to male pattern hair loss, women generally become bald or have a noticeable receding hairline. There can be numerous potential causes of female pattern baldness including emotional or physical stress, certain medications or medical conditions and more. Regardless of the cause, the condition can be frustrating. But, with proper understanding and care, it is possible to control this problem. Here is more on Female Pattern Baldness Treatment in Chandigarh.

		<p>In this condition, the growing phase of the hair drastically slows down and it takes a lot more time for the newer hair to start growing. With the shrinking of the hair follicles, hairs tend to become thinner and finer over time, which can cause easy breakage. Females can lose anywhere between 50-100 hairs on a daily basis but those suffering from female pattern baldness would lose more. This condition can be classified into three types:</p>
		<br>
		<p><img src="Image/bullet.png" width="15px" height="15px"><span style="font-weight: 800;">&nbsp&nbspType I: </span>Small and very less noticeable thinning begins around the part</p>
		<p><img src="Image/bullet.png" width="15px" height="15px"><span style="font-weight: 800;">&nbsp&nbspType II: </span>The part starts to widen and there is increased thinning around it</p>
		<p><img src="Image/bullet.png" width="15px" height="15px"><span style="font-weight: 800;">&nbsp&nbspType III: </span>Highly noticeable baldness around the top part of the scalp along with thinning of hair throughout</p>
		<br>
		<h2 style="color: #305942;">How to Prevent It?</h2>
		<br>
		<p>Preventing female pattern baldness is not always possible as the condition is genetic. But, women can follow certain preventive tips to prevent damage and breakage. Listed here are a few of them:</p>
		<p><img src="Image/bullet.png" width="15px" height="15px">&nbsp&nbspInclude essential vitamins, proteins and iron in their diet</p>
		<p><img src="Image/bullet.png" width="15px" height="15px"> &nbsp&nbspLimit treatments like straightening, hair extensions and perming that can cause hair damage Brushing </p>
		<p><img src="Image/bullet.png" width="15px" height="15px"> &nbsp&nbspBrushing the hair when it is fragile and wet can lead to hair breakage. Use your fingers instead to de-tangle it or wait till the hair is dry</p>
		<p><img src="Image/bullet.png" width="15px" height="15px"> &nbsp&nbspSafeguard hair from sun damage by wearing a scarf, hat or carrying a parasol.</p>
